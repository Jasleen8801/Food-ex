## Project Overview
The Discord API is a set of tools that enables developers to build bots or extend the functionality of their app using data and services exposed by Discord. In other words, the Discord API provides a programmable interface for developers to interact with Discord. REST is one of the ways your applications can interaction with the Discord API.
<br/><br/>
With Discord's REST API, it's possible for developers to fetch users' data, like their names and profile photos, by making HTTP calls to a specific endpoint. The developer can then use the data in an external app or in a Discord application.
<br/><br/>
Here, we've used one of the unpopular food API on the internet, **Spoonacular API**. This spectacular API allows us to understand the relationships between ingredients, recipes, nutrition, allergens, and more.
<br/><br/>
Integrating some of the HTTP calls from this API into our Discord server, **Food-ex** allows you to perform a variety of commands including searching through thousands of recipes using advanced filtering and ranking to provide the response to your query along with a specific ID. 
<br/><br/>
This ID is further used to access recipe information, nutritional value, tastiness or even cost approximation of the recipe. This bot also fetches some random recipe, joke or food trivia on specific command.
